Neuro-Call Center Project for SPbSMU Admissions Committee
Project Overview
This project aimed to develop a neuro-call center to assist the admissions committee of the Saint Petersburg State Medical University (SPbSMU). The objective was to create an AI-powered system capable of processing student inquiries through voice recognition and providing relevant responses based on an extensive knowledge base of the medical university.

My Role
As an assistant to the team lead in the internship team, my contributions to the neuro-call center project were multifaceted, encompassing both technical and leadership support areas:

Leadership Support: Assisted the team lead in managing the project timeline, delegating tasks, and ensuring seamless communication among team members. Facilitated problem-solving sessions and contributed to strategic planning and decision-making processes.

Speech-to-Text Conversion: Collaborated in the integration and optimization of speech-to-text services, such as Lemur and Yandex Speech Kit, ensuring accurate transcription of student inquiries.

AI Response Generation: Supported the design and development phases of the AI model, focusing on its ability to understand inquiries and generate appropriate responses based on a comprehensive medical university knowledge base.

Testing and Quality Assurance: Aided in rigorous testing to ensure the system's accuracy and efficiency, contributing to the overall reliability of the AI's responses.

Deployment to Production: Played a key role in deploying the neuro-consultant as a Telegram bot, facilitating real-time interactions with students on a popular messaging platform.
